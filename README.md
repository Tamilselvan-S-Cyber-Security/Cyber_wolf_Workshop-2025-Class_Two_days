## What is a CTF?
<p>Capture the Flags, or CTFs, are computer security competitions. Teams of competitors (or just individuals) are pitted against each other in various challenges across multiple security disciplines, competing to earn the most points.</p>

## Why play CTFs?
<p>Real-world vulnerabilities are featured in challenges, allowing you to flex your programming, problem solving, and teamwork skills! CTFs are often the beginning of one's cyber security career due to their team building nature and competitive aspect. In addition, there isn't a lot of commitment required beyond a weekend</p></br>
<p>CTFs bring these vulnerabilities right to your machine in small, compartmentalized challenges, fostering collaboration and community building (with friendly competition of course!).</p>

## ## Do I need special tools or computers?

<p>A terminal environment is essential to experiment and install tools in. Linux and MacOS systems should already have terminal emulators installed natively.</p></br>
<p>If you're on Windows, install Linux with WSL or setup a VM (virtual machine). See our recommended software.

## How to get started
<p>First of all, make sure to check out our recommended software section. It's handy to have these tools installed and ready as you get to solving some CTFs.</p></br>
<p>Ideally, you must have : - a decompiler like Binja - a debugger, gdb - a suite of web tools, Burp, sqlmap, and Wireshark are solid to begin with - the essential python package pwntools to interact with processes easily</p>

## Forensics
**Forensics is the art of recovering the digital trail left on a computer. There are plenty of methods to find data which is seemingly deleted, not stored, or worse, covertly recorded.**
</br>

**An important part of forensics is having the right tools, as well as being familiar with using them. Approach forensics challenges with an open mind. It's not uncommon to have obscure CTF challenges hide flags in the darkest of corners!**


## File Formats

<p>File Extensions are not the sole way to identify the type of a file, files have certain leading bytes called file signatures which allow programs to parse the data in a consistent manner. Files can also contain additional "hidden" data called metadata which can be useful in finding out information about the context of a file's data.</p>
